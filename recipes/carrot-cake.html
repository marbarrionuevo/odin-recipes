    <h2>How to make Carrot Cake</h2>
        <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h3>What's in Carrot Cake?</h3>
        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make your new go-to carrot cake recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sugars: </strong>You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil: </strong>A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla: </strong>Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners: </strong>Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon: </strong>Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt: </strong>Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Carrots: </strong>Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
            <li><strong>Pecans: </strong>Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter ans cream cheese: </strong>Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>How to make Carrot Cake Step-by-Step</h3>

        <ol>

            <li><strong>Bake the cake: </strong>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan or pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>

    <h3>Does Carrot Cake Need to Be Refrigerated?</h3>
        <p>Yes, carrot cake should be refrigerated. Since it's frosting with a fluffy cream cheese frosting, it shouldn't sit at room temperature for more than two hours at a time.</p>
        <h4>How Long Does Carrot Cake Last?</h4>
            <p>Store the frosted cake cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.</p>
        <h4>Can You Freeze Carrot Cake?</h4>
            <p>You can freeze unfrosted carrot cake for up to three months. Simply wrap the cooled cake in at least one layer of storage wrap, then at least one layer of foil. Thaw in the fridge overnight and frost according to the recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
